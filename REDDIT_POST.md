## For r/RealEstate (2.5M members)

**Title:** I'm about to pay $75,000 in commission to sell my house. This can't be right.

**Post:**
Selling my $1.25M property. Agent wants 6% = $75,000.

For what? Taking photos with an iPhone, putting up a yard sign, and listing on MLS?

I've flipped 250+ homes. Paid over $800k in commissions. That's $3,750/hour for maybe 20 hours of actual work.

Built a tool to expose this: https://comperpro.github.io/.red/

Calculate your own theft. I'm done with this racket.

## For r/FirstTimeHomeBuyers (500k members)

**Title:** PSA: That "standard" 6% commission will cost you $30,000+ 

**Post:**
First time buyers: On a $500k home, you're paying $30,000 in commissions.

That's a year of college. A new car. Your entire emergency fund.

For 20 hours of agent work.

Check what you're really paying: https://comperpro.github.io/.red/share.html

The 6% is negotiable. Everything is negotiable. Don't let them tell you otherwise.

## For r/REBubble (250k members)

**Title:** The real bubble: Agents making $3,750/hour while everything crashes

**Post:**
Market's correcting but commissions stay at 6%? 

Average agent works 20 hours per deal. At 6% on median home price = $3,750/hour.

Surgeons make $500/hour.
Lawyers make $1,000/hour.
Agents make $3,750/hour.

For putting a sign in your yard.

## For r/FlippingHouses (100k members)

**Title:** 250+ flips later: Stop paying 6% commission. Here's how.

**Post:**
I've flipped 250+ properties. Paid $800k+ in commissions.

Finally built a tool to track the true comps and expose the commission scam.

Free Chrome extension pulls real data from Zillow, calculates true values, shows you exactly what agents don't want you to see.

No BS, no sales pitch. Just truth about comps: https://comperpro.github.io/.red/

FSBO + flat fee MLS = keep your money.

## For r/personalfinance (15M members)

**Title:** Is paying $45,000 to sell my house normal? This seems insane.

**Post:**
Inherited a $750k property. Agent wants 6% to sell = $45,000.

That's more than many people make in a year. For what looks like 20-30 hours of work?

Am I missing something or is this a complete scam?

Found this calculator that breaks it down: https://comperpro.github.io/.red/share.html

Anyone else think this is insane?
