# Real-World Flipper Insights - 250+ Homes Worth of Hard Truths

## The REAL Comp Process (Not MLS Fairy Tales)

### Finding the Perfect Twin
1. **Identical homes are GOLD** - Same builder, same plan, same year
2. **Work backwards from ARV** (After Repair Value)
   - Find fully renovated twin
   - Subtract renovation costs
   - Account for ALL the hidden costs

### The True Cost Structure (What Nobody Tells You)

#### Hard Costs
- Purchase price
- Renovation costs (varies by market)
- Hard money: 9.5% + 0.5% + 1 point + $1k fee
- Closing costs (both sides)
- Property taxes (astronomical on vacant)
- Vacant property insurance (way higher)
- Utilities during hold

#### Soft Costs (The Silent Killers)
- **Holding time**: Average 4 months
- **City bureaucracy**: Can add YEARS (Oakland = 6 years!)
- Red tags if no permit, but permits take weeks/months
- Project manager: $150k+/year
- Trucks, equipment, overhead

## Red Flags That Kill Deals

### Water Issues (The #1 Destroyer)
- **Bad gutters** = Foundation problems + rafter rot
- Water not directed away from house
- Check bathroom floors around toilets
- Ceiling water spots
- Horizontal foundation cracks (vertical usually OK)

### Structural Problems
- Sloped/bouncy floors
- Weird additions (especially unpermitted)
- Funky layouts that can't be fixed easily
- Small kitchens (huge value hit)

### Deal Breakers
- **Squatters/Problem tenants** (6+ months to evict in Bay Area)
- Known code violations/red tags
- Asbestos/popcorn ceilings
- Single bathroom homes (way less valuable)

## What Actually Adds Value

### Standard Renovation Scope
- Full update but keep walls where they are
- New kitchen/baths
- New flooring
- Paint inside/out
- Update electrical/plumbing as needed
- New windows if needed
- Fix fences/deck

### The Inspection Walk
1. Step around floors checking for soft spots
2. Look up for water stains

4. Evaluate fence condition
5. Check window quality
6. Look for unpermitted additions
